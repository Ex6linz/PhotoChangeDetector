## Running the Application Locally

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/photo-change-detector.git
cd photo-change-detector
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ````bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
````
# or for Windows
   ````bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
````

### 3. Install the dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Run the Flask application:
    python run.py
## Running the Application with Docker
If you'd prefer to run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

### 1. Build the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-flask-app .
  
### 2. Run the Docker container:

    docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app

### 3. Open the browser and navigate to:

    http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Deploying the Application on Kubernetes

If you want to deploy the application on Kubernetes, follow these steps:

### 1. Log in to your Kubernetes cluster (if necessary).
### 2. Create a Kubernetes Deployment and Service:
Ensure you have the deployment.yaml and service.yaml files prepared.
### 3. Apply the Kubernetes YAML files:
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
### 4. Check the status of the Deployment and Service:
    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get services
